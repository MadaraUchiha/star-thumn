It also shows the star counter on hover and allows you to star/unstar images.

## Current features:

 - Oneboxed images in chat will become thumbnails.
 - Add or remove stars normally. The star button appears on hover.
 - Linked images in the form of `[text](image link)` (assuming nothing else on the message) will become thumbnails with `text` being a `title` on the image.
 - Images from `googledrive.com` will be properly thumbnailed with the `_thumb` suffix. Link will lead to full size image. *(This is [a thing](https://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/1161/chat-has-pictures-and-they-are-big) specific to our chat room.)*


## Planned features:

 - Proper thumbnailing for imgur images (use the `s` or `m` suffix to save bandwidth)
 - Accepting suggestions in answers below.
